In  [The Shallows](http://www.nicholascarr.com/?page_id=16), Nicholas Carr presents states how the Web and the hyperlinks are one of the bad agents of producing internet brains - hyper-connected, shallow, impulsive, and distracted.

This (WIP) extension tries to remove the hyperlinks from a given webpage so you can focus on reading.

There are three modes for a webpage:

* Normal Mode presents normal page

* Lineant Mode: Removes all the hyperlink from the page. Some styles are changed, but nothing like you can't read the page at all.

* Strict Mode: I'm still working on this, thinking of removing elements like audio and video from the pages.
